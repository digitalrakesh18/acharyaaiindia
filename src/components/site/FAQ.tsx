    q: "Is Acharya AI accurate?",
    a: "Our AI is trained on principles of Hasta Samudrika Shastra, the ancient Indian science of palmistry, combined with modern computer vision. Readings should be treated as spiritual guidance and reflection — not absolute prediction.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you store my palm image?",
    a: "Your palm scans are processed securely and never shared. You can delete your scan history anytime from your account.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which hand should I scan?",
    a: "Traditionally the dominant hand shows your present and future, while the non-dominant hand shows your inherent traits. You can choose either at the start of the scan.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will it tell me when I will die or about medical issues?",
    a: "No. Acharya AI never provides death predictions or medical diagnoses. We focus on emotional, spiritual, career and relationship guidance.",
  },
  {
    q: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    a: "We accept all major cards, UPI, and net banking via Razorpay for India, and Stripe for international payments.",
  },
